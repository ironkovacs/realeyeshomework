# REALEYES HOMEWORK
## Role: Web Application Developer
Build a currency exchange ASP.NET/C# MVC/AJAX web application. For that use the xml feed at
http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist-90d.xml and store currency rates in an inmemory
data-structure or database. Build a web interface that provides:
1. Exchange facility between two arbitrary currencies using the latest rate
2. Make sure when using the exchange facility there is no page reload and currency is computed asynchronous AJAX calls
3. Historical data presentation for any selected currency using Rickshaw or with any other clientside charting component with similar functionalities(https://shutterstock.github.io/rickshaw/)
4. Make the historical currency representation interactive like in this example (https://shutterstock.github.io/rickshaw/examples/lines.html) It’s possible that you might have some errors/problems with Rickshaw. In this case it’s also a part of the test to solve these problems.
